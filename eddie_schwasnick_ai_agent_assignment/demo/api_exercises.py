    '''
    I learned how to make API calls using requests in Python, how to write to JSON files, and how to handle errors and logging.
    A learned that making multiple API calls in a loop is straightforward, and I can extract and format data as needed. Looping through
    different countries as this example shows how easy it is to scale API calls for different parameters. I also learned that some APIs
    take a parameterized URL structure, which is useful for customizing requests in order to get desired data. Overall, this what a great
    exercise to understand the basics of working with APIs in Python. I'll definitely be using these techniques in future projects.
